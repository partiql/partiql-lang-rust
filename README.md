This is a collection of crates to provide Rust support for the [PartiQL][partiql] query language.

***The crates in this repository are considered experimental, under active/early development,
and APIs are subject to change.***

This project uses [workspaces][workspaces] to manage the crates in this repository.  The `partiql` crate is intended
to be the crate that exports all the relevant `partiql-*` sub-crate functionality.  It is factored in this way
to make applications needing only some sub-component of the PartiQL implementation possible (e.g. an application
that only requires the PartiQL parser can depend on `partiql-parser` directly).

Due to the lack of namespacing in [crates.io][crates], we have published `0.0.0` versions for the sub-crates we know
we will need.  A crate with a version `0.1.0` or higher, should have real, albeit potentially very experimental and/or
early implementations.

## Development
This project uses a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) to pull in 
[partiql-tests](https://github.com/partiql/partiql-tests). The easiest way to pull everything in is to clone the 
repository recursively:

```bash
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/partiql/partiql-lang-rust.git
```

You can also initialize the submodules as follows:

```bash
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Running the conformance tests
Running `cargo test` from the `partiql-lang-rust` root will not run the conformance tests by default.

To run all the tests (including conformance tests), you will need to run `cargo test` with the "conformance_test" `--features` flag:

```shell
cargo test --features "conformance_test"
```

Or to run just the conformance tests:

```shell
cargo test --package partiql-conformance-tests --features "conformance_test"
```

More details on running individual tests can be found in the `partiql-conformance-tests` crate [README](partiql-conformance-tests/README.md).
