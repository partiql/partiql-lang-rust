This is a collection of crates to provide Rust support for the [PartiQL][partiql] query language.

***The crates in this repository are considered experimental, under active/early development,
and APIs are subject to change.***

This project uses [workspaces][workspaces] to manage the crates in this repository.  The `partiql` crate is intended
to be the crate that exports all the relevant `partiql-*` sub-crate functionality.  It is factored in this way
to make applications needing only some sub-component of the PartiQL implementation possible (e.g. an application
that only requires the PartiQL parser can depend on `partiql-parser` directly).

Due to the lack of namespacing in [crates.io][crates], we have published `0.0.0` versions for the sub-crates we know
we will need.  A crate with a version `0.1.0` or higher, should have real, albeit potentially very experimental and/or
early implementations.
