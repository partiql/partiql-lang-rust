## [Unreleased]
### Changed
- *BREAKING:* Refactors the AST
  - Removed Location from the AST, replacing with a 'node id' that gives the AST node identity; the id can be used to retrieve Location

### Added
- Adds the following functionalities to PartiQL Playground:
  - Moves the project to a Node.js project
  - Adds the capability for exporting the playground session on client side to be able to get fetched from another playground windows.
  - Adds a REST API and exposes /parse for parsing the query over http request.
  - Containerization using Docker.

### Fixes
- Fixes the bug with AST graph PAN and ZOOM—before this change the pan and zoom was quite flaky and very hard to work with.
- Fixes the version value for the session and JSON output by ensuring it gets picked from the selected version in the UI.
